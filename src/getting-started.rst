Getting started with ActivityWatch is as easy as installing, starting it, and setting up autostart (if your installation method doesn't do it for you).

Installation
============

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: Windows

      Download and run the Windows installer for the `latest release on GitHub <https://github.com/ActivityWatch/activitywatch/releases>`_.

   .. group-tab:: macOS

      Download the ``.dmg`` for the `latest release from GitHub <https://github.com/ActivityWatch/activitywatch/releases>`_ and drag the ``.app`` to your Applications folder as usual, then add it to your autostart applications.

   .. group-tab:: Linux

      Download the `latest release from GitHub <https://github.com/ActivityWatch/activitywatch/releases>`_, unzip the archive into an appropriate directory, and add the ``aw-qt`` executable to your autostart applications.

      .. note::
         If you are using Arch Linux you can install ActivityWatch directly from `the AUR <https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/activitywatch-bin/>`_.

   .. group-tab:: Android

      Install it from the `Play Store <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.activitywatch.android>`_ or using the APK from the `aw-android releases page <https://github.com/ActivityWatch/aw-android/releases>`_.

      .. note::
         Getting it to F-droid is a work-in-progress, see `this PR <https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/merge_requests/5502>`_.


Usage
=====

The aw-qt application is the easiest way to use ActivityWatch. It creates a trayicon and automatically starts the server and the default watchers.

If you've installed by extracting a zip archive, simply run the ``./aw-qt`` binary in the installation directory (either from your terminal or on Windows by double-clicking). You now should see an icon appear in your system tray.

You should now also have the web interface running at `<localhost:5600>`_ and within a few minutes be able to view your data in the Activity view!

If you want more advanced ways to run ActivityWatch (including running it without aw-qt), check out the "Running" section of `installing-from-source`.

.. note::
   If you are running GNOME 3 or another desktop environment that does not support system trays, or if for some reason Qt can't be used on your machine, read `Running on GNOME`.

.. note::
   If you are using a proxy ActivityWatch might not work out of the box. To fix this you can set the environment variable ``NO_PROXY`` to include ``127.0.0.1`` before starting aw-qt. How to set an environment variable depends on your operating system; use Google if you are unsure how to do this.

Autostart
=========

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: Windows

      .. note::
         Autostart is set up automatically by the Windows installer.

   .. group-tab:: macOS
      You can automatically start ActivityWatch when you log in by [adding it to your Login Items](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-items-automatically-when-you-log-in-mh15189/mac).
      
   .. group-tab:: Arch Linux

      .. note::
         Autostart is set up automatically for Arch Linux by the AUR package, if your desktop environment supports `XDG Autostart <https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/XDG_Autostart>`_.
         
         You can set up autostart in other environments by adding [`dex`](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/any/dex/) (to enable XDG autostart) or simply `aw-qt` to whatever place you put your startup applications (i3 config, etc).

   .. group-tab:: Ubuntu

      Go to "Activities" or click the "Show Applications" button, search for "Startup Applications". Click "Add" and enter a name and optionally a comment. For the command, enter the path to the ``aw-qt`` executable in the application directory. For example, ``/home/<your username>/.local/opt/activitywatch/aw-qt``.

   .. group-tab:: Other

      You probably want to make ActivityWatch start automatically on login using your operating system's autostart settings.
      Searching the web for "autostart application <your operating system>" should get you some good results that don't take long. You want to start the ``aw-qt`` executable in the application directory.
