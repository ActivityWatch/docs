Importers
=========

ActivityWatch can't track everything, so sometimes you might want to import data into ActivityWatch from another source.

There aren't many yet, but here are some attempts:

- :gh-aw:`aw-importer-smartertime`, imports from `smartertime`_ (Android time tracker).
- LastFM importer, :gh-user:`ErikBjare` has code for it somewhere, ask him if you're interested.
