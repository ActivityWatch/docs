Vision and Usage of ActivityWatch
---------------------------------

The `vision <https://github.com/ActivityWatch/activitywatch/issues/236>`_ of ActivityWatch has always been for the betterment of the user.
May it be for personal, business, or solely research.


Monitoring of Unaware Individuals Using ActivityWatch
-----------------------------------------------------

In line with ActivityWatch's vision, the users of ActivityWatch should have full consent when they utilize this software.

Data privacy is a right to each individual, and the use of this program to monitor people without their knowledge will go against the design of ActivityWatch.


Employee Monitoring Using ActivityWatch
---------------------------------------

The monitoring of employees to check their activities can cause harm to workers and is inline with illegal employee surveillance.

To accomodate a monitoring feature for enterprises, the ActivityWatch team is currently planning implementations for a new feature (presently called Report) for the program.


Report Feature
--------------

The ` proposed plans <https://github.com/ActivityWatch/activitywatch/issues/233>`_ for the Report feature would be a whitelisting system. Users can whitelist activities they deemed private to report,
preventing personal data from being leaked.

It would also relay the employers with only work-related activities.
