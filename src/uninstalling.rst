Uninstalling
============

Uninstalling ActivityWatch should be straight forward.

If you've installed using an installer (Windows) you should be able to uninstall it like any other Windows application (through the 'Programs and Features' section in the Control Panel).

If you've installed by extracting a folder (Windows/Linux) or ``.app`` bundle (on macOS) then you can simply remove it.

After uninstalling, remember to remove or disable the web plugin as well. 

Removing data
-------------

Simply uninstalling ActivityWatch does not remove any of the data that's been collected.

To remove the data too, make sure to remove the data directories as well (see :doc:`directories`).
