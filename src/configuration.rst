Configuration
=============

Most common configuration options you need is in the Settings page of the web UI.

Other, more technical configuration options, are available through the config files. These are located in different places depending on your platform, see the `directories <config-directory>` documentation for where to find them.

.. note::
    In v0.11.0, the previous ``.ini`` config files used by all Python-based modules were replaced by ``.toml`` files (commented out by default, to allow for updates to the defaults). If you had made any modifications to the ini files prior to v0.11, you need to migrate them to the new files.

Configuration options for the server, client, and default watchers are listed below:

- :code:`port` Port number to start the server on.
