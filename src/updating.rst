Updating ActivityWatch is generally an uncomplicated process. 

If you've installed using an installer or package you can simply update by installing the new installer or package.

If you've installed by extracting a folder (Windows/Linux) or `.app` bundle (on macOS) then you can simply move or remove the old folder and replace with a new one. You do not need to worry about your data disappearing, as it's stored in a separate location (see the `directories`).
