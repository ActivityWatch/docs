Usage
============

Here we hope to clarify the founder's designed usage of ActivityWatch.

.. contents::

Intended Use of ActivityWatch
----------------

The `vision <https://github.com/ActivityWatch/activitywatch/issues/236>`_ of ActivityWatch has always been for the betterment of the user.
May it be for personal, business, or solely research.


Monitoring of Unaware Individuals Using ActivityWatch
------

In line with ActivityWatch's vision, the users of ActivityWatch should have full consent when they utilize this software.

Data privacy is a right to each individual, and the use of this program to monitor people without their knowledge will go against the design of ActivityWatch.


Employee Monitoring Using ActivityWatch
--------------------------------------------

The monitoring of employees to check their activities can cause harm to workers and is highly illegal employee surveillance.

The ActivityWatch team is currently planning implementations for an enterprise feature (presently called Report) for the program.


Report Feature
---------------

The `plans <https://github.com/ActivityWatch/activitywatch/issues/233>`_ for the Report feature would be a whitelisting system. Users can whitelist which activities to report,
preventing personal data from being leaked.

It would also relay the employers with only work-related activities.
